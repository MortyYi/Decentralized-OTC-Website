## How DOTC works
>The seller will transfer the cryptocurrency assets (such as USDT) to be sold, liquidated damages, to an open source smart contract on the blockchain in order to generate an order. In the order, the seller sets the amount of cryptocurrency sold, the price , Accepted currency, the amount of liquidated damages required by both parties, designate a third-party court on the blockchain. Add the public contact information and payment method to the order description information. The buyer searches for an order that meets the requirements, and contact the seller, Encrypted information (usually payment information) required to obtain an order. Click to buy and pay the liquidated damages in cryptocurrency. The sale and purchase contract is instantly concluded on the blockchain.

>Liquidated damages bind both parties to perform according to the conditions stipulated in the order. If one party breaches the contract, the other party can sue the other party in the court on the blockchain. After submitting evidence, the court will generate an on-chain judgment. The judgment of the court is just an asset allocation Scheme. The court can only distribute the cryptocurrency sold in the order and the liquidated damages to the buyer and seller proportionally according to the severity of the breach by both parties. The judgment of the court cannot distribute the funds of the order to any other third party or the court itself .

>As shown in the picture above, the central position of the picture is the smart contract on the blockchain. When the seller wants to sell cryptocurrency assets (such as USDT), he needs to issue an order, and each order has a unique number. Add up from 1. Order numbers will not be repeated.

>When the seller publish an order, in fact, the DApp client program of dotc.trade will apply to the user's wallet to pay the asset to be sold (such as USDT) to the smart contract, pay the gas fee of the blockchain network with the native coin, and use the native coin to pay the gas fee of the blockchain network. Liquidated damages paid in native coin too.

>The buyer clicks to buy on the order, then the buyer needs to pay the gas fee in the native coin and the liquidated damages set by the seller with native coin.

>Gas fees are earned by the miners of the blockchain.
